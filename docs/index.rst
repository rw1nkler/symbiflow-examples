Welcome to SymbiFlow examples!
==============================

This guide explains how to get started with SymbiFlow and build example designs from the `SymbiFlow Examples <https://github.com/symbiflow/symbiflow-examples>`_ GitHub repository. It currently focuses on two FPGA families:

- Artix-7 from Xilinx,
- EOS S3 from QuickLogic.

Follow this guide to:

- :doc:`install SymbiFlow <getting-symbiflow>` and all of its dependencies,
- :doc:`build <building-examples>` and :doc:`upload <running-examples>` example designs onto the devboard of your choice.
